- Basic commands
	- `FORWARD x` and `BACK x`, implemented in Processing as `.forward(x)` and `.back(x)`
	- `LEFT theta` and `RIGHT theta`, implemented as `.left(theta)` and `.right(theta)`
	- `PENUP` and `PENDOWN`, implemented as `.penUp()` and `.penDown()`
	- `REPEAT n`, implemented as a `for` loop
- A potential stumbling block is that, when using the Turtle, we must measure polygons by their exterior angles, not their interior angles
	- These are supplementary to the interior angles
- <details> <summary> Here's a geometry puzzle: if a circle is created (approximately) by repeatedly running `FORWARD x, RIGHT theta`, for some small value of `theta`, what will the radius of the approximated circle be? </summary> The radius is `x/(2*sin(theta/2))`, which is approximately `x/theta` for small values of `theta`. </details>
