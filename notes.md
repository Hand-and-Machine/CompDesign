Notes on possible future class/research topics that Buechley suggested.

- Self-assembly
    - Paper from Buechley: [Meshing complex macro-scale objects into self-assembling bricks](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12257)
    - [4D Printing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4D_printing)
        - [Sequential Self-Folding Structures by 3D Printed Digital Shape Memory Polymers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4562068/pdf/srep13616.pdf)
        - [Multi-shape active composites by 3D printing of digital shape memory polymers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4829848/pdf/srep24224.pdf)
    - [Consistent concepts of self-organization and self-assembly](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cplx.20235)
    - [Self-assembly at the macroscopic scale](https://www.academia.edu/2813249/Self_assembly_at_the_macroscopic_scale)
        - This paper focuses on macroscopic man-made self-assembling systems, not microscopic or naturally-occurring ones
        - At the macroscopic scale, microscopic thermal effects are negligible, so external agitation of the system is required
        - Penrose's simple 1D replicator - try to 3D print these pieces?
        - Hokusawa self-assembling hexagons: triangular prisms with magnets of opposite orientation in two of their sides
        - High-budget examples: contain programmable hardware/microcontrollers or switchable electromagnets
        - White et al: communication between cubes allowed for synchronized disassembly and reassembly
        - Much previous research has to do with large collections of simple robots (with very little functionality, e.g. simple docking functionality and some limited motor control) efficiently self-assembling by docking with each other
        - Docking between pairs of robots can be difficult
        - Random idea from me: one reason why it might be advantageous for robots to self-assemble into larger solids is to conserve heat - a set of N^3 cubical robots has a total surface area of 6N^3 when they are disassembled, but a surface area of only 6N^2 when they are assembled into a larger cube, meaning a slower rate of heat exchange with the environment 
    - **Question:** of the polyhedra that tesselate 3D space (e.g. tetrahedron, cube, hexagonal prism, rhombic dodecahedron, etc) which will "settle into" a tesselated configuration when placed into a bin and agitated? All of them? None of them?
- Discrete fabrication
    - Cardboard construction kit, suggested by Buechley: http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.12/people/charles.fracchia/wk1.html
    - Zome tools? Tangrams? Legos?
    - This might fall more under "discrete design" rather than "discrete fabrication" - but it could be pretty cool to see what kind of aperiodic tilings result from different sets of generating tiles: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aperiodic_sets_of_tiles
        - Self-assembling tilings?
    - Jigsaw puzzles?
        - Could we design a jigsaw puzzle that can be assembled into two (or more) distinct solutions?
- Ceramic 3D printing
    - FORMLABS 3D printer: https://formlabs.com/store/3d-printers/form-2/
        - from $2400 to $2900 to $3500, good for printing smaller/finer objects
        - other 3D printers from formlabs are extremely pricy!
        - uses actual stereolithography
        - ceramic resin designed for Form 2 printer: https://archive-media.formlabs.com/upload/ceramic-user-guide.pdf
        - ceramic resin (for experimentation and prototyping) is $149/L, technical data about its physical properties can be found here: https://archive-media.formlabs.com/upload/Technical_Data_Sheet_EN_-_Ceramic.pdf
    - CERAMBOT 3D printers: https://www.cerambot.com/store/
        - CERAMBOT Pro is $700, CERAMBOT Air is $600
            - Can also buy individual parts - are they included when you buy the full printer, or must they be purchased separately?
        - Layer thickness between 0.1 and 2 mm
        - Uses Kalonite HAP or other pastes
        - Guide to clay for 3D printing: https://www.cerambot.com/clay-for-3d-printing/
- Nontraditional printing materials
