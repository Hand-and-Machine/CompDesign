- write a .copy() method for Solid and Face
- write a .overwrite(solid) method for Solid that copies the solid efficiently by copying (clones of) its preexisting data structures, rather than rebuilding them from scratch
- implement ConvexSolid.add_hull_vertex and ConvexSolid.hull
- implement PlatonicSolid and ArchimedeanSolid by importing preexisting .solid files
- implement Conway polyhedron operators (again?!)
