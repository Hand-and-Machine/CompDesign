It's not obvious how to install new modules or run external scripts from within Rhino Grasshopper's Python console. I'm still figuring out how to do this myself, so for now, this just consists of my disorganized notes. As I work out solutions, I'll flesh this out into a more organized tutorial.

- Rhino uses IronPython, which doesn't go past Python 2.7. This means that, in order to use packages like NumPy that are only being maintained for newer distributions of Python, we'll need to download older versions. For NumPy, this means using NumPy 1.6.2 rather than the newest version. Older versions of packages can sometimes be found on SourceForge.
- When Rhino is opened as a normal application (at least on MacOS), it doesn't have permission to read/write files in certain folders by default. The only solution I've found for this so far is to run the Rhino application as the root user, which can be accomplished by going to the directory `/Applications/Rhino 7.app/Contents/MacOS` and running `sudo ./Rhinoceros`. This strikes me as mildly dangerous, though, so I'm looking for a workaround.
  - Perhaps root privileges aren't needed if Rhino is just installed in a particular user's `Applications` folder, rather than the root `Applications` folder?
- Here's one way to run your own external scripts, but it feels a bit... wrong. Navigate to the directory `Applications/Rhino 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/RhCore.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/ManagedPlugIns/RhinoDLR_Python.rhp/Lib` (which is either located in `/Users/[YOUR USERNAME]` or the root directory, depending on where Rhino is located). Create a simple script entitled `helloworld.py` containing the line `print("hello world!")`. Then, in Grasshopper, add the line `import helloworld` to your code. You should see "hello world!" pop up in your console, as expected.
  - It seems like we should be able to use this to run external packages like NumPy by simply downloading their source code and copying it into this directory. However, most packages (NumPy included) require some additional setup that is usually taken care of automatically when you use `pip` to install Python packages. Can I use `pip` to setup *and* install the correct distributions external packages into this directory?
